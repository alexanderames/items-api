# Items Api

This is the Api repo for the Items app. It should be run in conjunction with the **items-client** repo.

## Up and running

To get the app up and running, pull down this repo and run the following commands in your terminal:

- `rails db:create db:migrate db:seed`
- `rails s --port 5000`

### Notes

This Api uses Postgres, so please have that running in the background as well.
